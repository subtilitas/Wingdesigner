All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- STEP faces of symmetric airfoils: the leading-edge split parameter snaps to an existing knot
  within 1e-10.
- Airfoil import: Lednicer detection requires the upper surface to start at the leading edge;
  a closing point after a blunt trailing edge is removed; input above 2,000,000 characters is
  rejected; HTML tag stripping runs in linear time.
- Airfoil check: `te-missing` is an error; duplicate points are removed before the checks.
- Loft: negative blended thickness in smooth spanwise mode is reported as an error.
- UI: rejected autosave data is kept under a separate key; keyboard shortcuts are inactive while a
  dialog is open; input focus survives a rebuild; empty or invalid number fields restore their
  value; export formats are disabled while the wing has errors; equal section span positions are
  rejected.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- NURBS core: B-spline basis functions, curve and surface evaluation, global interpolation,
  knot insertion and splitting.
- Airfoil import for Selig, Lednicer, x/upper/lower tables, XML and HTML tables with sanity checks
  and preview; NACA 4-digit and 5-digit generator.
- Half-wing loft through NURBS-interpolated sections with linear or smooth spanwise blending,
  nose-line and end-line guide curves, and three trailing-edge modes.
- Mirroring at y = 0; closed triangle meshes; STEP (AP214 B-rep with B-spline faces), STL, 3MF and
  project JSON export.
- Browser UI: 3D view with touch controls, planform editor, sections table, airfoil library and
  upload, settings, checks with planform statistics, new-design wizard, undo and redo, autosave.
- Wing tip modes: flat, or pointed with the tip profile scaled to 1/100 to 1/1000 of the previous
  section chord; wizard tip option.
- Adaptive spanwise stations where the loft deviates more than 0.5 mm from the intended planform.
- CI with unit tests, README coverage check, OpenCascade STEP validation, browser smoke test and
  GitHub Pages deployment; wiki publishing; tagged releases.
